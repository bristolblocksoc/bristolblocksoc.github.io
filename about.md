The University of Bristol Blockchain Society is a student-run society that brings together students (and staff members) from various disciplines, such as Computer Science, Economics or Law, with interest
in the up-and-coming technology of Blockchain and its applications.

We, the committee are a small group of 4 individuals passionate about learning about all things Blockchain. The establishment of the society is a result of us recognising a demand for Blockchain-related events. We consider to be novices in the field ourselves, so it is partly scratching our own itch. We aim to be inclusive in our approach, i.e., be equally welcoming to students and staff within the Department of Computer Science as well as people who may not necessarily have a technology background. The society is as much interested in the technological underpinnings of Blockchain as it is in its applications and legal, ethical, or other issues surrounding its use.

The society organises a variety of events within the University. This includes talks, socials, and regular hack nights.
